LSLVL can be developed using any conventional
software development model. However, the biggest
bottleneck in that would be securing the funding.

We will illustrate how Duniix may overcome such problems
with our "Own a Piece of the Web" (OPOW) approach,
which is essentially a combination of of the following elements:

1. free software, 
2. metaprogramming training,
3. international cross platform (cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies) online tipping.

All these are possible because of the Decentralized User Authentication Scheme employed in Duniix.

CSVM methods (Create Search View Modify) exist in conventional software development model. Typically, nowadays, a popular framework, such as React is chosen. Subsequently, development consists of modifying existing sample code or adding new code.

LSLVL can be implemented as a clone of YouTube using the conventional software development model.

Using the Duniix approach, we consider the following factors:

1. Create: A new video clip may be created using any existing social media app, including TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Tweeter, Instagram, etc, or Duniix own LSLVL module.

2. Search: Searching LSLVL videos becomes a "interesting" (complicated) problem, as they consist of videos published via various different social media apps.

Suppose we generalize the problem by downloading the web pages containing individual LSLVL clip to a local drive on Duniix server. Then the problem becomes one of searching HTML source code to extract the target video (identified by a URI).
