In [W+007 (W+007: A Metaprogramming Perspective on Create Search View Modify (CSVM) Model)](https://github.com/udexon/Webpp/blob/main/W%2B007_Meta_CSVM.md), we gave a high level overview of the conventional and Duniix web ecosystems, based on the CSVM (Create Search View Modify) model.

In this article, we shall describe several examples of conventional websites or apps, to illustrate their limitations, which we seek to overcome with Duniix.

1. As of 2021, established retail businesses such as Princess Polly
would have the following:

- a. Own website, with E commerce facilities,
equipped with payment systems provided by a third party.
- b. Social media accounts, to promote and interact with customers.


2. Smaller retail businesses may not have (1a),
but a "store front" in an E commerce website such as
Amazon or Alibaba. They will also use social media
to promote and interact with customers.


3. Everyone is subject to competition. However, cost and fame are two mutually inverse properties, that have not been fairly utilized by conventional web and apps, where [Duniix Recommendation Reward Token (DRRT)](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU001_Phoshell.md) provides a unique groundbreaking solution!

By using DRRT, vendors (individual, small, medium, large businesses) may offer discount or rewards to friends, who can promote the business (goods or services or training) to friends of friends, and track the recommendations using the cryptographic tokens in DRRT.
