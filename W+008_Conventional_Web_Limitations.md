In [W+007 (W+007: A Metaprogramming Perspective on Create Search View Modify (CSVM) Model)](https://github.com/udexon/Webpp/blob/main/W%2B007_Meta_CSVM.md), we gave a high level overview of the conventional and Duniix web ecosystems, based on the CSVM (Create Search View Modify) model.

In this article, we shall describe several examples of conventional websites or apps, to illustrate their limitations, which we seek to overcome with Duniix.

1. As of 2021, established retail businesses such as Princess Polly
would have the following:

- a. Own website, with E commerce facilities,
equipped with payment systems provided by a third party.
- b. Social media accounts, to promote and interact with customers.


2. Smaller retail businesses may not have (1a),
but a "store front" in an E commerce website such as
Amazon or Alibaba. They will also use social media
to promote and interact with customers.


3. Everyone is subject to competition. However, cost and fame are two mutually inverse properties, that have not been fairly utilized by conventional web and apps, where [Duniix Recommendation Reward Token (DRRT)](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU001_Phoshell.md) provides a unique groundbreaking solution!

By using DRRT, vendors (individual, small, medium, large businesses) may offer discount or rewards to friends, who can promote the business (goods or services or training) to friends of friends, and track the recommendations using the cryptographic tokens in DRRT.

The most critical features in DRRT are that it is decentralized and user centric, without a centralized authority, and can be managed co-operatively by multiple parties (Vendor, Customer A, who recommends Customer B, who in turn recommends customer C, and so on ...)


## 4. What can DRRT contribute to a language learning service / app such as LSLVL?

Users of LSLVL may use DRRT to recommend sponsor's business to friends while browsing LSLVL.

e.g. A shampoo vendor may sponsor one of the language lesson in LSLVL. Viewers may then recommend this shampoo to friends.


## 5. What are the significance of (4) using DRRT in LSLVL?

LSLVL Learn a Second Language by Video Blogging is perhaps the most pervasive theme specific social media activity since TikTok &mdash; anyone can be involved, by making a short video, teaching and learning a new word in a second language; it can include anyone speaking any language, at any location on Earth.

DRRT is a novel invention that can monetize "recommendation" by creating cryptographic tokens to track the "path" of such recommendations (from a friend to friends of a friend and so on ...)

Combining LSLVL and DRRT, we literally have the most powerful advertising network, which is also accessible fairly to everyone on Earth, including vocally impaired people who may use sign language in LSLVL videos.
