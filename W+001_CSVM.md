# W+001 CSVM: Create Search View Modify

In [DU004 (Modify HTML DOM with Python Selenium)](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU004_Modify_HTML.md), we demonstrate how to "Modify HTML DOM with Python Selenium", as the title suggests.

We wish to use this elementary example to demonstrate some very fundamental principles in Duniix web programming, based on a seemingly simple but crucial idea &mdash; owning a piece of the World Wide Web.

The Web and Social Media (including mobile apps) 
may be characterized by the following steps:

1. Create
2. Search
3. View 
4. Modify

Although web pages were developed prior to 
social media, the latter have become more 
popular and hence more familiar to most users.
As such, we shall describe social media 
based on Duniix CSVM framework first, before
generalizing it to web pages.

1. Create: A social media user creates a new post or a comment to follow up an existing post.
2. Search: Social media usually have search facilities for users to search posts or comments. However, as we shall examine later, the search functionalities of most social media are not satisfactory.
3. View: Viewing social media posts and comments are the default function of all social media apps.
4. Modify: Proprietary social media apps do not allow third party programmers to modify the apps. However, open source social media apps allow them to do so.

In contrast to social media apps, the search functionalities offered by search engines such as Google for web pages are perhaps the most powerful available from very early on, driving the growth of the Internet as well as fueling the online economics.

By comparing social media apps to web pages based on the CSVM (Create, Search, View, Modify) model, we may reveal some interesting insights.

1. Create: The owner of a website is free to create any web page according to any format that he (she) wishes, in contrast to social media posts or comments, which are restricted to certain specified formats.
2. Search: It is a well accepted experience that web page search engines such as Google perform more satisfactorily compared to social media search functions. This is a critical issue that we shall explore further.
3. View: Viewing web pages is just the default function of a web browser.
4. Modify: Anyone is free to modify existing web page templates or framework code, as they are usually open source.

In the next section, we shall look into the details
of implementing LSLVL Learn a Second Language by Video Blogging
using Duniix to illustrate the CSVM framework
and comparisons with conventional social media,
 search engines and web pages.
