# W+001 CSVM: Create Search View Modify

In [DU004 (Modify HTML DOM with Python Selenium)](https://github.com/udexon/DUNIIX/blob/main/DU004_Modify_HTML.md), we demonstrate how to "Modify HTML DOM with Python Selenium", as the title suggests.

We wish to use this elementary example to demonstrate some very fundamental principles in Duniix web programming, based on a seemingly simple but crucial idea &mdash; owning a piece of the World Wide Web.

The Web and Social Media (including mobile apps) 
may be characterized by the following steps:

1. Create
2. Search
3. View 
4. Modify

Although web pages were developed prior to 
social media, the latter have become more 
popular and more familiar to most users.
As such, we shall describe social media 
based on Duniix CSVM framework first, before
generalizing it to web pages.
