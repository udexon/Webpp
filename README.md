# Duniix Web++: A Decentralized User Centric Web
Duniix Web++: Let's Own A Piece of the Web

Owning a piece of the Web sounds great, until you are shocked by your own reluctance to change the status quo, or the attitude of the people around you.

We will attempt to explain the problems and solutions within the next 5 sentences, as we believe that is the patience of most readers in this TikTok era.

1. You do not own any piece of the Web today primarily because almost all the web and mobile services use Centralized User Authentication Scheme (CUAS), where your user identity is managed by a centralized system.

2. We overcome this limitation by using Decentralized User Authentication Scheme (DUAS) which is part of our groundbreaking Duniix Web++ system.

3. We will demonstrate that to use, learn and program with Duniix Web++ are as easy as spreadsheet formulas, thanks to the Phoscript metaprogramming script, derived from the Forth programming language.

4. Besides being easy to use, learn and program, Duniix Web++ allows you to earn rewards with it Decentralized Recommendation Reward Token (DROIT), where unlimited levels of rewards or discounts can be calculated based on the recommendations made by you and friends, signed and encrypted using Duniix Decentralized Sign & Cipher (DSC) scheme.

5. Finally, Duniix Web++ gives you the biggest breakthrough since the invention of Bitcoin itself — PhosPay,  a decentralized, user centric, inter-blockchain and international (fiat currencies) payment exchange platform — where users can make international payment starting from below USD1 with negligible transaction fees, with transient public key as temporary ID, thus enabling 99.99% of users without cryptocurrency wallets to enjoy the benefits of cryptocurrencies.
