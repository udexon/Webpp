# W+007: A Metaprogramming Perspective on Create Search View Modify (CSVM) Model

Experienced programmers may wonder what novelties
there are in W+006 (Making a video thumbnail HTML page)?

The answer lies in what happen AFTER the video thumbnail
page is created.

1. Most importantly, how would anyone find out about it (Search)?

- a. Search Engine, 
- b. Social Media, 
- c. Recommendation with Rewards (RWR).

Send RWR in email or private messages. Like word of mouth.

2. Next, how would anyone respond (follow up, comment, like, down vote, etc.) on it? (Create)

3. Also, is it possible to modify the existing pages
other than using conventional methods? (Modify) 

Consider this statement:

- Human programmers are metaprograms as we 
create and modify programs.

- How may we describe and represent the process
by which human programmers write programs?
