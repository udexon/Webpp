# W+007: A Metaprogramming Perspective on Create Search View Modify (CSVM) Model

Experienced programmers may wonder what novelties
there are in W+006 (Making a video thumbnail HTML page)?

The answer lies in what happen AFTER the video thumbnail
page is created.

1. Most importantly, how would anyone find out about it (Search)?

- a. Search Engine, 
- b. Social Media, 
- c. Recommendation with Rewards (RWR).

Send RWR in email or private messages. Like word of mouth. Compare to advertising mechanism in search engines. Duniix allow anyone to contribute code to improve (Modify) any part of CSVM, including Search.

2. Next, how would anyone respond (follow up, comment, like, down vote, etc.) on it? (Create)

3. Also, is it possible to modify the existing pages
other than using conventional methods? (Modify) 

- M = Modify = Metaprogramming ??

4. Consider this statement:

- Human programmers are metaprograms as we 
create and modify programs.

- How may we describe and represent the process
by which human programmers write programs?

5. Before we further explore the issues above, we would like to re-emphasize that, the CSVM (Create Search View Modify) model is a useful and comprehensive framework to characterize and analyse various aspects and issues concerning web services and technologies, as we shall subsequently demonstrate.
