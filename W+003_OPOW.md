## W+003: How can we ensure LSLVL will be developed in such a way that is not monopolized like conventional web and apps such as MAGA+F (Microsoft Amazon Google Apple Facebook)?


We will illustrate how Duniix may overcome such problems
with our "Own a Piece of the Web" (OPOW) approach,
which is essentially a combination of of the following elements:

- 1. free software, 
- 2. metaprogramming training,
- 3. international cross platform (cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies) online tipping.

All these are possible because of the Decentralized User Authentication Scheme employed in Duniix.



1. In the conventional software development model, 
the major shareholder of the company employing the
programmers has the absolute power on decision making.

In Duniix software development model, we highlight individual's role as
PUSH:

- P: Programmer 
- U: User
- S: Shareholder
- H: Owner of Hardware Devices, that make up Duniix network

The conventional company structure dictates a centralized system, where funds are spent to acquire and maintain hardware at centralized locations, to serve users in segmented geographical areas, even if the users are spread out globally.

Thanks to DUCT (Decentralized User Contract Token), the basis of DRRT (Duniix Recommedation Reward Token), Users now have a mechanism to manage the following resources, down to the smallest units, 
with the freedom to join or leave the network at any time, 
without a centralized authority, such as a company:

- a. Program code, measured by Phoscript Words (function names);
- b. Hardware capabilities in terms CPU power, network capacity, storage and memory;

One of the most important enabling factors
in Duniix network in contrast to conventional
services is the utilization of User's mobile devices
as Duniix nodes, which are increasingly powerful,
as substitute for server facilities in conventional systems.

As such, individual user may assume the roles of User and Hardware Owner
at the same time, resulting in a change in Shareholder role (see PUSH models above).


2. Phoscript is a metaprogramming language derive from the Forth programming language, which is practically as easy to learn as spreadsheet formulas, yet powerful enough to interface to any programming language and framework, as illustrated in the following articles:

- https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Phoscript_Tutorials.md

- https://github.com/udexon/Webpp/blob/main/W%2B004_Metaprogramming.md

- https://github.com/udexon/Webpp/blob/main/W%2B006_View_LSLVL.md

As such, the roles between User and Programmer begin to blur, when Users begin to contribute coding to Duniix projects, which also contribute to a change in the role of Shareholder (PUSH model).

3. In summary, by engaging in Programming (P) or contributing own hardware (H), User (U) may claim a Share (S) from Duniix business (PUSH model).
