We will illustrate how Duniix may overcome such problems
with our "Own a Piece of the Web" (OPOW) approach,
which is essentially a combination of of the following elements:

1. free software, 
2. metaprogramming training,
3. international cross platform (cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies) online tipping.

All these are possible because of the Decentralized User Authentication Scheme employed in Duniix.
